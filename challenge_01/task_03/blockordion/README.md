# Blockordion

This WordPress plugin project is my solution for the "Senior Challenge - Accordion Block - Part 1".
The challenge consists in creating an Accordion Block that may contain multiple items that can be toggled.

For this Part 1 of the challenge, the body exclusively utilizes Rich Text and does not incorporate any other content types.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release zip file from the [releases page](link-to-releases).
2. Upload the zip file through the WordPress admin interface (`Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin`).
3. Activate the plugin.

## Usage

1. Add the Accordion Block to your post or page using the Gutenberg editor.
2. Add multiple items to the accordion.
3. Customize the title and body content for each item.
4. Rearrange or delete items as needed.
5. Save or update your post or page.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily rearrange items within the accordion.
- **Title and Body Content**: Each item in the accordion can have a custom title and rich text body.
- **Responsive Design**: The accordion is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes.
