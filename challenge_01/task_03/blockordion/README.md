# Blockordion

This WordPress plugin project is my solution for the "Senior Challenge - Accordion Block - Part 1".
The challenge consists in creating an Accordion Block that may contain multiple items that can be toggled.

For this Part 1 of the challenge, the body exclusively utilizes Rich Text and does not incorporate any other content
types.

## Features

- **Title and Body Content**: Each item in the accordion can have a custom title and rich text body.

- **Items added or removed directly via a menu in the editor and not Inspector panel**

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily rearrange items within the accordion.
