## Blockordion Plus

This WordPress plugin project represents my response to the 'Senior Challenge - Accordion Block - Part 2.
The project is a bit similar to "Blockordion" project. The project enables users to use an Accordion Block capable
of managing multiple toggleable items. Unlike the initial project, this version allows for diverse content types in the
body, not limited solely to rich text.
